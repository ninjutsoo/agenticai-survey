ABSTRACT 
Background: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) can plan tasks, use 
external tools, and coordinate with other agents. Unlike standard LLMs, agents can 
execute multi-step processes, access real-time clinical information, and integrate 
multiple data sources. There has been interest in using such agents for clinical and 
administrative tasks, however, there is limited knowledge on their performance and 
whether multi-agent systems function better than a single agent for healthcare tasks.  
Purpose: To evaluate the performance of AI agents in healthcare, compare AI agent 
systems vs. standard LLMs and catalog the tools used for task completion 
Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from October 1, 2022, through 
August 5, 2025. 
Study Selection: Peer-reviewed studies implementing AI agents for clinical tasks with 
quantitative performance comparisons. 
Data Extraction: Two reviewers (A.G., M.O.) independently extracted data on 
architectures, performance metrics, and clinical applications. Discrepancies were 
resolved by discussion, with a third reviewer (E.K.) consulted when consensus could not 
be reached. 
Data Synthesis Twenty studies met inclusion criteria. Across studies, all agent systems 
outperformed their baseline LLMs in accuracy performance. Improvements ranged from 
small gains to increases of over 60 percentage points, with a median improvement of 53 
percentage points in single-agent tool-calling studies. These systems were particularly
