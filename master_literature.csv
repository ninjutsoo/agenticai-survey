AIHOSPITAL25,AI Hospital: Benchmarking Large Language Models in a Multi agent Medical Interaction Simulator,2025,Primary system,Diagnosis/Dialogue/Education,Multi-agent,Society,Mixed,Peer,Soft,Session,Frozen,Architectural,Partial,Multi agent simulation environments and collaborative clinical interaction,Introduces a simulated hospital environment where diagnostic performance emerges from multi agent interaction and dispute based peer coordination rather than single agent reasoning.
PATHFINDER25,PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology,2025,Primary system,Diagnosis,Multi-agent,Hierarchical,Centralized,None,Hard,Session,Fine-tuned,Architectural,No,Multi-modal diagnostic agent systems,"Hierarchical multi-agent workflow that gates cases, iteratively collects evidence, and synthesizes diagnostic decisions with explanations"
AgentMD2025,AgentMD: Empowering language agents for risk prediction with large-scale clinical tool learning,2025,Primary system,Diagnosis/Workflow/Evidence,Single-agent,Solo,Centralized,Symbolic,Hard,Session,Frozen,Architectural,Partial,Tool-using clinical agents with symbolic execution,AgentMD shows that a single centralized language agent coupled with executable clinical tools and hard symbolic verification can outperform pure language reasoning for clinical risk prediction.
ENTAgents25,ENTAgents: AI Agents for Complex Knowledge Otolaryngology,2025,Framework,Diagnosis/Education/Evidence,Multi-agent,Hierarchical,Centralized,Peer,Hard,Session,Frozen,Architectural,No,Hierarchical multi-agent clinical reasoning with supervisory control,"ENTAgents exemplifies a clinically oriented hierarchical agent architecture where a supervisor enforces iterative self-correction and information retrieval, highlighting how control and verification design shape reliability in specialty medical reasoning."
